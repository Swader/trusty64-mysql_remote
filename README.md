# Ubuntu 14.04 Vagrant - with addons

This vagrantfile was created for a SitePoint article.

It boots up a 14.04 Ubuntu server instance and installs the default MySQL into it.
It also enables remote connections to the MySQL server, so you can hook into it with
MySQL workbench or any other tool of your choice via the VM IP and the default 3306 port.

I will be expanding this box to include options like HHVM, PHP 5.6 and more.

PRs welcome.
